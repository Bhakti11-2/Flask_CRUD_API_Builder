# Flask CRUD API Builder

## Overview
This utility helps you to quickly generate boiler-plate code for a sample CRUD Rest API.

You can view a live demo at: [crudapibuilder.herokuapp.com](https://crudapibuilder.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage
 - Provide entity name. It could be anything like `users`, `groups`, etc. This becomes the base for all API endpoints.
 - Define the fields of entity in structure. Structure is defined as a key-value pair of field names and its data types (Pythonic).
   
   Sample sturcture:
   ```python
   {
       "name": str,
       "email": str,
       "username": str,
       "number": int,
   }
   ```
 - Click on `Build`. It will download a file called `boilerplate.py` which can be simply deployed with:
   ```python
   flask run
   ```
   Pre-requisite:
   
   `$ pip install flask`
